GCD of two numbers

Note:
The LCM of two integers n1 and n2 is the smallest positive integer that is perfectly divisible by both n1 and n2 (without a remainder)
GCD = a * b / lcm(a, b)

Code :
class Solution {
    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if(b == 0){
            return a;
        }
        return gcd(b, a%b);
    }
}
